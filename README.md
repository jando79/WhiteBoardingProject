### Questions

#### Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs
_URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20._

_You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion._

###### Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

#### Question #2: Array Deduping
_Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion._

###### Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

#### Question #3: Compressing Strings
_Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion._

###### Example
Input: "aaabccdddda"

Output: "3ab2c4da"

#### Question #4: Checking for Uniqueness
_Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean._

###### Example
Input: "hello"

Output: false

Input: "copyright"

Output: true
